this is the 'final' project i worked on after a string of smaller projects and failures. not meant to be anything besides a simple solution to a specific problem only we have. You're more than welcome to use this if you'd like, but I imagine anyone who has an issue like ours will just do their own from scratch. 

Anyways, here's the thought process. She works the same schedule every 2 weeks, which is easy to keep track of on paper, but not in my head. Building this not only gave me an excuse to dive back into GUI's and Python in general, but also have a way to help her and show off some of the aesthetic parts of programming. 

She loves Kuromi and she loves stationary, so I figured I might as well model this calendar after a little notepad of days, which will highlight her working days in a clear and obvious way. 

Functionality of the calendar is primarily for sifting through weeks at a time, not so much for day-to-day events. I removed the options to select days, the # of weeks in the year, i had to change the calendar to start on a Sunday instead of Monday (really?? is that common?)

Anyways, I had a lot of fun with this because I keep saying I don't like working with GUI's very much; mostly bc of how dangerous they can be to productivity. I can spend 20-30 minutes just on the colors alone, but once I've decided on a color scheme and a layout, I'm pretty much set. 

Be on the look out for the new Beacon Films video on the Hero's Journey. I'll go over this project and others in that video.
